# Logging

All services developed by Qlik will follow a pattern there all logging is sent to `stdout` and the format of the log message will be in JSON.

This allows you to pick up logs either by CLI
`docker logs <container id>` or use a log driver such as gelf to forward all logging to a service. This use case has a logstash service that transforms the log messages (if needed) and adds it to a elastic search database. All messages can then be searched and visualized by kibana.

The system clock must be set for the UTC 00:00 timezone (a.k.a Zulu), and events must be logged in this timezone.

## Example configuration
```
qix-engine:
	image: qlikea/engine
	command: -S TrafficLogVerbosity=5 -S EnableTTL=1
	logging:
		driver: gelf
		options:
			gelf-address: udp://localhost:12201
```

### Verbosity of QIX engine logging

 The verbosity of different log types is set through command line parameters when starting the docker container.

 `command: -S TrafficLogVerbosity=5 `

| Name	| Description | Default verbosity value째|
| --- | --- | --- |
| SystemLogVerbosity | System log | 4 |
| AuditLogVerbosity	| Audit log |	0 |
| PerformanceLogVerbosity	| Performance log |	4 |
| SessionLogVerbosity	| Session log |	4 |
| TrafficLogVerbosity	| Traffic log |	0 |
| QixPerformanceLogVerbosity	| QixPerformance log |	0 |
| SmartSearchQueryLogVerbosity	| SmartSearchQuery log |	3 |
| SmartSearchIndexLogVerbosity	| SmartSearchIndex log |	3 |
| SSE	| Server side extension log |	4 |

째 (Off =0, Fatal=1, Error=2, Warning=3, Info=4, Debug=5)

### Collect the logs

Depending of the deployment the logging sent to `stdout` can be collected in different ways. Amazon has CloudWatch, there are logging as a service (e.g. logit.io) and in this use case we deploy the ELK째 stack and use the [gelf logdriver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/gelf) to forward the log messages. Looking at the configuration above all messages sent to `stdout` will be picked up by the gelf driver and forwarded to `udp://localhost:12201` there logstash (on every node) will receive the messages, transform them and post them to the elastic search database hosted on the manager node.
